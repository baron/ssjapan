Liquidity is created by matching assets within the system. This mechanism helps keep $JOC its value. The value of $JOC is based on the total number of assets pooled within the pool.

JOC Tokens will gradually be released into the liquidity pool from the respective prize multiplier (e.g., 5x, 10x, etc.).
