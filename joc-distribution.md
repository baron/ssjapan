The **$JOC** compensation is paid per Block, like **Liquidity pools**. The difference is that players do not need funds to create liquidity, you get compensated in $JOC by just playing the game.

The compensation will be proportional to each occupation to create a balance for each line of work.

JOC Tokens will gradually be released into the liquidity pool from the respective prize multiplier (e.g., 5x, 10x, etc.).

**25% to Therapist gameplay**
