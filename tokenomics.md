### &#x20;<a href="#joc-tokens-usdjoc" id="joc-tokens-usdjoc"></a>

This utility token is mainly used for character development of the player, such as vocational skills, or upgrades. You can also use them to restore a character's work fatigue or to purchase items related to the player. For all these player specific upgrades you will need **$JOC**
