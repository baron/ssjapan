# JOC Reduction

### &#x20;<a href="#joc-token-mechanism" id="joc-token-mechanism"></a>

As **$JOC** is a limited token, in order not to run out of liquidity within its distribution, the **$JOC** that is used mechanically within the game will be added equally to both pools to maintain that liquidity.

In order to help balance both gameplay and economics within the game, we have developed a system that will remove **$JOC** out of the circulating supply by creating a character development system. Character training will be done through various types of mini-games, and **$JOC** will be used to pay for these mini-games. The details of the mini-games are discussed in the Gameplay section.

Expertise is separated into 4 career paths within the game, but you will be unable to develop mastery of them all. You can see more details in the **Gameplay**. Please note that when a player levels up, this affects their overall status. In order to balance the gameplay, when one career increases, the other career stats will decrease according to quadrilema rules.

Each player's character has energy, and when a player performs any activity within the game, this energy will decrease. Energy can be restored over time or by buying energy restoration items in the shop. With regards to these items, please note their price is higher than any **$JOC** return that players can get from the mini-game. However, players can receive benefits other than **$JOC**, such as gaining experience, and earning **$SPEED**.
