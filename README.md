Do you have the skills to raise, train and care for the well-being of your own virtual horse? Can you use these skills to transform your equine into the very best racehorse it can be? Do you have the keen eye of a breeder to select the ideal partner for your horse? Could you develop the expertise to effectively manage a racehorse ranch with any offspring from this breeding? Or do you have the finances to invest and are willing to hire others? If you can answer yes to some of these questions, then the **Speed Star simulation game** within the **Starverse** universe is for you!!



In the Starverse universe you can choose any role that suits. You can play the game as an investor, or there are several roles you can undertake as a player, such as being a virtual jockey, trainer, breeder or therapist! The game is developed by the **Hell Factory team**, and will run on the high-performance network **Harmony ONE**, and it is scheduled for launch on **March 31st 2022**.



**Starverse:** Within the Starverse universe there is no "Play to Earn" concept, but instead it is a **"Work to Earn"** philosophy. That's because by working at Starverse, you will be rewarded with experience, fun, and financial rewards from doing so.

Everybody and everything has a story to tell, and Starverse is no exception.

This story originates with an incredible star, on which there was abundance and plenty. It was here that the first pair of horses were born. However, we do not know who created these majestic creatures, or how they evolved.

What we do know is the first was named ‘**Adam the horse**’ and the second called ‘**Eve the horse**’. They roamed the Gardens of Eden and lived together peacefully, eventually falling deeply in love with each other. Over time their union led to the birth of millions of offspring that eventually scattered all over the star. These uniquely wonderful creatures were imbued with special qualities, shapes and majesty. They also possessed a particular speed of movement, which was faster than any other living organism.

After millions of years passed, eventually another form of life evolved on the star. These beings were called humans. Sadly on their initial encounters, humans and horses understandably feared each other. Fortunately, as the centuries passed, a symbiotic relationship developed and they began to depend on each other. This led to humans learning how to raise their horses with love and understanding. They developed skills in feeding, training, and educating them. Humans learned to treat their horse’s ailments and how to care for them in order to bring the very best out of them. Eventually, the horses began to leave the forest, their natural habitat and moved to live alongside humans.

So this is ‘**Speed Star’**, a place of peace, harmony and tolerance. Let us explore this place together while having fun and reaping its rewards both in terms of gameplay and in financial rewards.

**Choose the role you want to be.**

In Speedstar, everyone can own a ranch. In the game, there are a number of distinct and clearly defined roles that exist for individual players. You could choose to provide the necessary training to improve your horse’s stamina and results (**Trainer**). Obviously a horse can’t race by itself, so it needs someone to ride and guide it through the races (**Jockey**). There is also the option to play the game by caring for and treating any fatigue or illnesses of the horse (**Therapist**). Or finally you might have the keen eye on lineage and pedigree in order to become an expert horse breeder (**Breeder**). So, please carefully choose the role that suits you! Then work on developing expertise in exchange for rewards!
