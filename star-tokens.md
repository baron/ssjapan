As the development team unlocks $STAR to cover the initial cost of the system, 4% (84,000 STAR) of the reserve will be unlocked per month. This process will take a total of 25 months.

For Investors, there is a vesting arrangement in place. The unlocking of investor tokens will begin one month after the initial release of the Development Funds. Over the proceeding 50 months from this unlock, 2% of the Investors funds (30,000 STAR) will be unlocked per month. This is to prevent investors from damaging the market value from the number of coins that are unlocked.
